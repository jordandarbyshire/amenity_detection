## **Project Overview**
### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from an [article](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/amenity-detection-and-beyond-new-frontiers-of-computer-vision-at-airbnb-144a4441b72e) I came across that highlighted an Airbnb computer vision project where they aim to detect room type by the types of objects identified in their listing photos.

I was also interested in this project because of my interest in the Computer Vision field, which is still rapidly evolving. I have a love for travelling, and I have had a lot of experience using these rental sites. 

### Motivation
The purpose of this project is to identify objects from images of homes uploaded onto vacation rental sites. Potential customers browsing vacation rental sites are looking for specific amenities in their vacation rental. For example, they want an oven to cook in, a pool to swim in, a pool table for entertainment... the list goes on. When a property owner creates an ad on a vacation rental website, they would usually manually type in their amenities or select from a large list. Inaccurate amenities can result in lost revenue due to bad reviews or last-minute cancellations.

Users of the website will search for properties based on their desired amenities, and will be shown a list of properties based on their preferences. What if there was an easier way to add amenities to the listing, simply by uploading the property images without the manual labor? This is where Object Detection come in.

### Potential Applications
Any hotel or vacation rental site such as Airbnb, Vrbo, Hotels.com, TripAdvisor, etc.
