    "The purpose of this project to identify objects from images of homes uploaded onto vacation rental sites. Potential customers browsing vacation rental sites are looking for specific amenities in their vacation rental. For example, they want an oven to cook in, a pool to swim in, a pool table for entertainment... the list goes on. When a property owner creates an ad on a vacation rental website, they would usually manually type in their amenities or select from a large list. Inaccurate amenities can result in lost revenue due to bad reviews or last-minute cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of the website will search for properties based on their desired amenities, and will be shown a list of properties based on their preferences. What if there was an easier way to add amenities to the listing, simply by uploading the property images without the manual labor? This is where Object Detection come in."

    "The dataset I used for this Capstone project is Open Images V4, which contains 1.99 million images spanning 600 classes. The dataset is open source, put together by Google. It is \"the largest existing dataset with object location annotations\", it includes bounding boxes manually drawn by humans to ensure accuracy and consistency [Source](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures_v4.html). The images often show complex scenes with several objects (8 annotated objects per image on average) [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00982). There are yearly competitions based on this dataset for the purpose of advancing the Computer Vision field."

If the images did not come with these bounding box \"labels\", I would have had to create these manually using open source software. To begin this project, I decided that I would choose 20 classes most applicable to this problem. To go about this, I chose the classes most relevant to each room type: Bedroom, Bathroom, Living Room, Kitchen, and Outdoor. On the Open Images website, you are able to download a csv that lists all of the classes contained in this dataset. I filtered the dataset to 30 classes based on what amenities would be the most desirable to the consumer."

    "I quickly realized that the biggest challenge with starting a project for Object Detection is putting together a dataset to run models on. Since the Open Images dataset is so large, it would be a monumental task to download the full dataset (split into 513GB for training, 12GB for validation and 36GB for testing), and sort through it to get what I need. The Open Images website does not provide an option to download select classes of images. Fortunately, I discovered that there are a few open source solutions to this problem. I attempted a few different \"toolkits\" that promised to solve this problem by downloading only desired classes. I ended up going with the [OIDv4 ToolKit](https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit) to complete the task."

    "Released in 2019, this model is a Single Shot Detector (SSD) model that goes straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities. By using SSD, we only need to take one single shot to detect multiple objects within the image. Compare this to R-CNN that needs two shots, one for generating region proposals, one for detecting the object of each proposal. Thus, SSD is much faster compared with two-shot RPN based approaches. [Source](https://towardsdatascience.com/review-ssd-single-shot-detector-object-detection-851a94607d11). The model architecture is based on inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers as opposed to traditional residual models. Moreover, nonlinearities are removed from intermediate layers and lightweight depthwise convolution is used. This model is part of the Tensorflow object detection API.

Focal loss is very useful for dealing with class imbalance, especially in object detection tasks.
